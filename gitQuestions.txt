2) Modified is when you change something in the files. it's the first stage
	Staged means it's in a queue of what you want to do. You can choose what you want to do.
	commited adds a commit tag to it, therefore it's a full version of the product
3) The working directory is your local directory which includes modified, commits, and all the local files.
	It means whether git can change things to the file, such as merge, push, pull, commit.
