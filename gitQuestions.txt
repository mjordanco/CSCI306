1) Git uses SHA-1 hash by adding it to each commit, this is how it keeps track of commits and any conflicts from a couple of commits.
2) Modified is when you change something in the files. it's the first stage
	Staged means it's in a queue of what you want to do. You can choose what you want to do.
	commited adds a commit tag to it, therefore it's a full version of the product
3) The working directory is your local directory which includes modified, commits, and all the local files.
	It means whether git can change things to the file, such as merge, push, pull, commit.
4) a remote repository is an area/spot to store code to a non local server.

1) git init
2) git add README.txt
3) git add *.java
4) git status
5)git mv README README.txt
6) git add -u code.java
7) git status
8) git rm -f junk.java
	git rm --cached junk.java
9) git log
10) git log -n 2
11) git log --since="Sept 1"
12) git log --author="myusername"
13) git reset HEAD blah.java
14) git remote add origin git://github.com/CyndiRader/JavaDemos.git
15) git remote
16) git clone git://github.com/crader@mines.edu/DemoJava.git

1) when it gets added to the staging area then modified before committing.
2) git add will both start tracking a file in the repository, and stage a file
3) .gitignore is a file that defines types of files that git should not track in the repo. Commonly this will include compiled files, or other machine specific files.
4) git checkout -- myCode.java completely discards any local changes to the file myCode.java. Checkout it dangerous because it isn't necessarily recoverable.
